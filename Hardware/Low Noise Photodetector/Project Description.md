## Low Noise Photodetector

The goal of this project was to design a low-cost, open source version of the versatile Newport 2011-FC low-noise photodetector [Link](https://www.newport.com/p/2011-FC-M). The cost is roughly a tenth of the original photodetector and runs off a DC power supply.

### Wish list
* Dual 9V battery power supply for better noise performance
* Integrated ADC and USB interface
* Digitally controlled DC offset

### Current issues
* Bandwidth much lower than spice simulations predict. Needs investigating.
